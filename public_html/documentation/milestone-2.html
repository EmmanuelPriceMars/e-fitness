<h1> content strategy</h1>
<p><stronge> My website is a portfolio with a very simplistic design. A beautiful background, some css animation and a combination of empty space are the sites bread and butter.
    the banner at the top contains my name with the title of  fullstack web developer.
    a list of competencies will also be included in that banner. a tiny picture of myself will sit on the page with a singular link below it saying contact me.
    upon click this link will open my contact form.
