<P> I would like my personal website project to help people find appropriate workout programs tips and tricks for their skill level. No matter their age group </P>
<p>This website  will be for my potential customers, but also a show of skill to my potential employers.
my audience will be comprised of the elderly, middle age out of shape people and anyone looking for a place to start moving on a workout
</p>
<p> The goal will be to serve as a showcase to promote my work.
</p>
