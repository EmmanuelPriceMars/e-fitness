<p>About: rose knows her way around her laptop for basic things like her task at work. she can handle basic browsing
but gets intimidated easily at the sight of complication. she typically prefers to use her phone as she finds it much easier to manage then her computer.
    Rose loves watching the olympics the athletes remind her of her youth days. she is a big fan of yoga and healthy lifestyle guids.
    Rose has been gaining weight lately.
    she knows she has to work out, but she does know where to start.She is also pretty lazy she doesnt want to do too hard workouts.
    she googles easy workout programs and finds e-fitness.
