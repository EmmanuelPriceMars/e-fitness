<h1>PWP</h1>

<P><li> I would like my personal website project to help people find appropriate workout programs tips and tricks for their skill level. No matter their age group </P>
<p><li>This website  will be for my potential customers, but also a show of skill to my potential employers.
my audience will be comprised of the elderly, middle age out of shape people and anyone looking for a place to start moving on a workout
</p>
<p><li> The goal will be to serve as a showcase to promote my work.
</p>

<h2>Persona</h2>

<li>Name: Rose</li>
<li>Technology: SmartPhone HTC plus 8, HP laptop i5 Win10</li>
<li>Role: Regular user</li>

<p>About: rose knows her way around her laptop for basic things. she can handle basic browsing
but gets intimidated easily at the sight of complication. Rose has been gaining weight lately.
    she knows she has to work out, but she does know where to start. she googles easy workout programs and finds e-fitness.
    on that website she can look at free workout programs for people of all levels. her goal is to find one best suited
    for her skill, that she can execute at home in her own time.
